# Global Quality Gates

- Run relevant validation after code/config changes.
- Keep generated artifacts and temporary backups out of git history.
- Keep hooks and automation scripts non-interactive.
- Prefer stable, scriptable workflows over manual one-off steps.
- If tests cannot run, explicitly report the gap.
